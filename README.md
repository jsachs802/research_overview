# A Showcase of Selected Research 

Welcome to Jeff Sachs's public github repository! 

Jeff Sachs is a computational social science researcher. He received his PhD in sociology from Yale University and works as an academic researcher of organizational behavior. Jeff uses quantitative and computational approaches to examine organizational problems. Jeff’s research contributions include: 

 1. Costs/tradeoffs in the prediction of information diffusion across different groups.
   * _Practical Applications:_
        - Information requirements and costs related to managing the spread of information.
        - Understanding the complexity of prediction in a complex system.
        - Costs associated with targeting hard to reach population segments.
    
 2. The impacts of social networks on group fairness measures.
   * _Practical Applications:_ 
        - Evaluating decision-making dynamics and knowledge flows in an organization.
        - Measuring bias in organizational culture.
    
 3. Techniques for removing selection bias in social media data samples.
   * _Practical Applications:_ 
        - Generating representative samples of social media data. 
        - Making population inferences with social listening data. 

Jeff has also completed projects on generative AI and LLMs in his research. Currently, Jeff serves as a post-doctoral social science researcher for the USDA Forest Service as part of the Wildfire Crisis Strategy, gathering data and analyzing communication landscapes surrounding wildfire adaptation with the objective of shrinking information gaps between adaptation programs and stakeholders. 

Overall, Jeff’s research focuses on organizational flows and evaluating problems related to communication, decision-making, and resource allocations.
