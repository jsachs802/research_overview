# A Showcase of Selected Research 

Welcome to Jeff Sachs's public github repository! 

Jeff Sachs is a computational social science researcher. He received his PhD in sociology from Yale University and works as an academic researcher of organizational behavior. Jeff uses quantitative and computational approaches to examine organizational problems. Jeff’s research contributions include: 

 1. Costs/tradeoffs in the prediction of information diffusion across different groups.
   * _Practical Applications:_
        - Information requirements and costs related to managing the spread of information.
        - Understanding the complexity of prediction in a complex system.
        - Costs associated with targeting hard to reach population segments.
    
 2. The impacts of social networks on group fairness measures.
   * _Practical Applications:_ 
        - Evaluating decision-making dynamics and knowledge flows in an organization.
        - Measuring bias in organizational culture.
    
 3. Techniques for removing selection bias in social media data samples.
   * _Practical Applications:_ 
        - Generating representative samples of social media data. 
        - Making population inferences with social listening data. 

Jeff has also completed projects on generative AI and LLMs in his research. Currently, Jeff serves as a post-doctoral social science researcher for the USDA Forest Service as part of the Wildfire Crisis Strategy, gathering data and analyzing communication landscapes surrounding wildfire adaptation with the objective of shrinking information gaps between adaptation programs and stakeholders. 

Overall, Jeff’s research focuses on organizational flows and evaluating problems related to communication, decision-making, and resource allocations.

NOTE ON CODE:
The projects below were added to this public repository after their completion. Not all the code is available for some projects. In these cases, the code is too dependent on data that cannot be made publicly available. That is, some code is not very useful without the data.


### Academic Research 

1. [Fair Diffusion](https://github.com/jsachs802/research_overview/blob/main/fair_diffusion/fair_diff_readme.md)
   - _Abstract_:
   This research investigates fairness in information spread within 14 distinct Ugandan villages, focusing on
   the distribution of information about a political participation technology. The study applies a Simulated
   Method of Moments to assess the impact of different network metrics and fairness definitions on the
   spread of information across male and female villagers. Initial findings highlight significant differences
   in the likelihood of achieving fair outcomes with various interventions. Although some fair strategies
   show slight improvements, they still exhibit low probabilities of fair outcomes. The introduction of a
   new fairness definition, Seed Average x Coverage Fairness, enhances the prediction of fair outcomes
   across many network metrics, albeit with a trade-off in the efficiency of information spread. The research
   underscores the difficulty of controlling outcomes in a complex system, and the dynamics of efficiency
   and fairness, demonstrating that context plays a vital role for these processes. 

3. [The Tik Tok Self](https://github.com/jsachs802/research_overview/blob/main/tiktokself/tiktok_readme.md)
   - _Abstract_: The COVID-19 pandemic has shifted many social worlds from in-person interaction to online activity. As a result, people increasingly have the freedom to choose more agreeable everyday environments. While 
   such freedom has often been associated with negative outcomes – namely, the emergence of “echo-chambers” that corral insensitivity – this data visualization suggests a positive outcome: “flowering-chambers”, where the 
   freedom has enabled expressions of a truer self. Drawing on an original dataset of TikTok videos, the visualization charts a considerable increase in the number of “coming out” gender identity and sexual orientation 
   videos during the latter three quarters of 2020. These results suggests that many TikTok users have publicly revealed private aspects of their identities, which we attribute to individuals becoming increasingly 
   embedded in agreeable online spaces while quarantining or socially distancing. The visualization additionally introduces a publicly available dataset of 4.8 million TikToks to facilitate future research using data 
   from the platform.

5. [Embedding Regression](https://github.com/jsachs802/research_overview/blob/main/embedding_reg/embed_reg_readme.md)
   - _Abstract_: How does social media content affect users’ online discourse? Existing scholarship sheds light on how users’ speech can be influenced by several social media features involving content. However, this 
   research often conflates content’s lexical dimension with its symbolic dimension. The authors analyze how the symbolic properties of online content can distinctly affect discourse on social media. Specifically, they 
examine how the symbolic meanings conveyed by Twitter’s reinstatement of Donald Trump’s account influenced Twitter users’ discourse. The results of embedding regressions indicate that Trump’s reinstatement immediately 
   shifted users’ discourse about social and political identity-based groups, but only when they discussed Black and Jewish people. Additional results suggest that the discourse became more politicized and that the 
 discursive shift was short-lived. The authors’ findings contribute conceptual and analytical clarity to the socio-semantic dynamics of online discourse, encouraging future research to distinguish and compare the 
   lexical and symbolic dimensions of online content.
