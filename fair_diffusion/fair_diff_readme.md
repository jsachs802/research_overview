#### Fair Diffusion Project

Abstract: This research investigates fairness in information spread within 14 distinct Ugandan villages, focusing on the distribution of information about a political participation technology. The study applies a Simulated Method of Moments to assess the impact of different network metrics and fairness definitions on the spread of information across male and female villagers. Initial findings highlight significant differences in the likelihood of achieving fair outcomes with various interventions. Although some fair strategies show slight improvements, they still exhibit low probabilities of fair outcomes. The introduction of a new fairness definition, Seed Average x Coverage Fairness, enhances the prediction of fair outcomes across many network metrics, albeit with a trade-off in the efficiency of information spread. The research underscores the difficulty of controlling outcomes in a complex system, and the dynamics of efficiency and fairness, demonstrating that context plays a vital role for these processes.

### CODE 

NOTE: Whenever I do a project, I create a project template which has a specific root/path setup (See here for instructions on how to do this). The scripts found here often rely on linkages to eachother, but I have redacted the paths since potential users will probably not have the same directory setup. For this reason, configuring the scripts to work with eachother will require you to reestablish the paths.
