### THE TIKTOK SELF

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has shifted many social worlds from in-person interaction to online activity. As a result, people increasingly have the freedom to choose more agreeable everyday environments. While such freedom has often been associated with negative outcomes – namely, the emergence of “echo-chambers” that corral insensitivity – this data visualization suggests a positive outcome: “flowering-chambers”, where the freedom has enabled expressions of a truer self. Drawing on an original dataset of TikTok videos, the visualization charts a considerable increase in the number of “coming out” gender identity and sexual orientation videos during the latter three quarters of 2020. These results suggests that many TikTok users have publicly revealed private aspects of their identities, which we attribute to individuals becoming increasingly embedded in agreeable online spaces while quarantining or socially distancing. The visualization additionally introduces a publicly available dataset of 4.8 million TikToks to facilitate future research using data from the platform.
